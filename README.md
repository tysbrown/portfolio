# Portfolio

My professional portfolio built with an Eleventy front-end and Sanity Studio back-end, hosted on Netlify. 

## Front-End
The Eleventy front-end lives in the /web directory. Data from the Sanity Studio is queried with GROQ/JavaScript in the /\_data directory.

## Back-End
I'm running Sanity Studio as a back-end to store data/content. It lives in the /studio directory. Schemas for the data can be found in the /schemas directory.
